# Document Updater

A specialized skill for maintaining and updating the project's `README.md` file to ensure it accurately reflects the latest architectural decisions, tech stack, features, and setup instructions.

## Workflow

1. **Information Gathering**:
   - Read `GEMINI.md` as the primary source of truth for project context and standards.
   - Read `package.json` to verify current dependencies, versions, and scripts.
   - Read `prisma/schema.prisma` (or relevant ORM schema) to confirm the database structure.
   - Scan the `src/` directory if necessary to understand the actual file structure.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Compare the current `README.md` with the gathered information.
   - Identify outdated sections, incorrect tech stack details, or missing features.
   - Ensure that setup instructions (environment variables, commands) are accurate.

3. **Execution**:
   - Rewrite or patch `README.md` with the corrected information.
   - Maintain a consistent, professional, and concise tone.
   - Use clear headings, tables, and code blocks for readability.

4. **Validation**:
   - Verify that all links and commands in the updated `README.md` are valid within the project context.
   - Check for any remaining discrepancies.

## Constraints
- Do NOT add "just-in-case" information. Keep it focused on what's actually in the project.
- Follow the existing style and formatting of the `README.md`.
- Prioritize accuracy over verbosity.
